As a beginner to programming, Python initially appeared to be near impossible to learn. Despite reassurance from multiple people that Python is one of the simplest pgramming codes, I felt that there were too many ways I could screw up, whether it be an additional comma or bracket or other unknown errors.
DataCamp has really helped me to understand some fundamental concepts of Python which has enabled me to develop code that 2 months ago, would've been completely foreigh to me.
The purpose of this website is to display some fundamental code that I have learned and found helpful along my journey of learning Python.
I will go through DataCamp chapters and pull out some code that has showed me entirely different ways of analyzing data. I will give some examples in relation to a new dataset and show step-by-step solutions of how to create some code that will help to solve a particular question or problem!
